## Goal

The goal is to have an app where a user can select a persona card, write a message and have the message transformed to sound like how the selected persona would say that message. An example would be: Lets say on the homepage I select shakespeare. Once I click on the shakespeare card I am directed to a tab where I can type a message. On the backend, I will be using the OpenAI API programmed with a specific personality to match the selected persona. In this case Shakespeare. It will then take that message and transform it/ rewrite it to sound like shakespeare said it. There would be an option to copy the text so the user can paste it where ever they want. They should be able to edit their message, or be able to regenerate for more options.

There will be the following tabs in my application

## Persona tab

Here there is a list and pictures of available personas to select from. users can scroll to see their options. they can then select one where they are taken to the the message tab

## The Message tab

this is where you go after selecting a persona. Users can type a message in the input and press a button to then transform/rewrite their message into how their selected persona would say it. Users can then press the copy button to take the output text so they can paste it elsewhere. The selected persona will persist on this page. So if they come back to the app they can keep using this persona or they can go back to the persona tab and pick a new one to write a message.

## History tab

finally there is the history tab. this will show; the Selected persona, and the conversation history from that session.

That is the app. Its simple. We dont have to worry about color scheme and styling too much, there is already preset styles in the repo we can use.
